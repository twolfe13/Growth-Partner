  "The following year in 2012, I applied for VP of Business Development and got it.   After getting leads, going to meetings with CEOs myself, I was then thrust into being responsible for my own team of sales people.  I led team meetings, trained and guided people to produce sales activity.",
  "The coolest part to me looking back, is we were able to engage salespeople to make calls, use the CRM, etc. - without even having the option to pay them!  It was so cool to me because we were students, selling a real service that made real revenue and impacted businesses - and even people from other countries. ",
  "I dove more in to AIESEC since then (much more than my studies), and eventually became VP of Business Development, then Local President in 2014.. representing NIU in the national plenary alongside top students from schools like Yale and Cornell.",
  "Being responsible for a team and being in such diverse groups of people, taught me a ton about engaging people in a work scenario.. especially those from the 'millennial' generation'. We even developed a talent 'product' called Millennial Leader to recruit more top talent.  The same sales work I do 10 years later, we did even in a more robust and dynamic manner back in AIESEC as students. ",
  "While most poeple were in class, I could be found in the library pitching people on LinkedIn, or taking calls in the back where it was quiet if I got a response (good timing. Call me X), or driving to meet executives I cold called or pitched.   My grades suffered, but I knew the practical sales experience I was getting that other students were simply learning about, would pay off in the end.",

  "After I left university and AIESEC in 2015, after finishing my President term (responsible for BD and Account Management, among other functions like Talent Management), I decided to do a sales internship through AIESEC in the UK.  Working for AIESEC again, getting paid this time.. I was one of 4 US based AIESECers selected to bring our sales experience and knowledge to AIESEC UK - including conducting training at their National Conference.  I was assigned to the Birmingham LC (2nd largest city in the UK) and lived near Birmingham University during the summer of 2015.",
  "After the AIESEC UK stint, it was time to enter the workforce in Chicago, and put my rich AIESEC experience behind me.  I had plenty of opportunities on my radar through the network of CEOs I had built selling AIESEC, and my participating in the College of Business at NIU.  Eventually I identified a Chicago recruiting / services start-up called PreScouter, who was looking for an employee #1 to help them launch a side business called Scholar Source.  It seemed like a good fit, and I could tie in my prior recruiting experience.  I ended up helping the Co-Founder strategize the entire go-to-market effort - writing the outbound pitches, setting up a CRM using Podio (I used it in AIESEC), among other sales processes - even the recruitment process.  We ended up being successful getting the venture of the ground, and I closed my 1st recruiting services deal with Miracle Gro - a $1B+ company.",
  "The Founder was keen to keep me on board, but I decided it wasn't for me.  To me the traditional headhunting industry was on the way out, and I saw a bigger opportunity in software development services.  Even more than a job I could make a lot of money in, I wanted to make impact, like in AIESEC.  So I decided to check the international initernships database for a spanish-speaking opportunity (I took spanish in high school), and found an opportunity with a 20-person custom software development company in Montevideo, Uruguay.  I didn't know anything about Uruguay, but I knew the person who already accepted the 2nd available Go To Market role - he did sales in AIESEC for University of Texas in Austin - so I took the opportunity.  My research told me there was a billions dollars opportunity in the Nearshore IT market.",

                below) selling international talent to Chicagoland businesses,
                to help fuel their international expansion / growth initiatives.
                Upon joining my first role was as a Business Development team
                member, covering "SDR" and "AE" activities. I was responsible
                for hunting and developing leads, and closing sales. This is
                when I first made cold calls, used a CRM, and closed my first
                deal (generated $5,000 in revenue, which seemed like alot at the
                time!) that I'll never forget.
